# Obesity Risk Factor Identification

## Project Overview
This project utilizes advanced data mining techniques to identify key risk factors associated with obesity. By analyzing a dataset comprised of various health, lifestyle, and demographic features, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform public health strategies.

### Objectives
- To identify significant risk factors for obesity.
- To develop predictive models that can accurately classify different levels of obesity.
- To provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on a merged dataset obtained from multiple public sources, including detailed information about individuals' lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and medical histories.
